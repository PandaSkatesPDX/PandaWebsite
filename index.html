        <p>I'm a inline skater from Portland, Oregon. I've been skating since July of 2024 when a group of skaters stopped by my work. Curious about what was going on, I talked to one of the skaters what was going on. They told me they were all part of a group called Bridge City Skate and that there was a beginner friendly skate on Mondays. With an old pair of K2's in my closet, I figured it wouldn't hurt to check it out. And so, a couple weeks later I tried inline skating for the first time. While I enjoyed the challenge of learning something new, what really got me hooked was the community. I fell in love with all the amazing people I met and have been skating ever since. :)</p>
